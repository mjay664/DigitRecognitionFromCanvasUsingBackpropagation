# DigitRecognitionFromCanvasUsingBackpropagation
This project was developed in python 2.7 using PyCharm Community Edition IDE. Application uses backpropagation algorithm to recognize digits. Application provide a canvas area on which a digit is drawn using mouse pointer, as we press enter, image of the drawn digit is resized to 32x32.After flattening image we get 1024x1 array. Now this array is fed to pretrained backpropagation algorithm.
The backpropagation algorithm is not implemented efficiently, but for a newby its okay I think. To train model data was generated using canvas itself. 300 images form each category. The data was generated by a single person hence the pre trained model is not that much accurate.
